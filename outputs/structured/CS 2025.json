Write a C program that reads a text data from a file named \"filel and [IOM] process the text to remove consecutive duplicate characters. The output is then written back to the file. Ensure your program handles the cases such as empty file or single-character content: Note: Do not use <string h> and <ctypeh> _ Example: Input: \"Thiiis is aa teesttt \" Output: \"This is a test \" a_ Write the algorithm for a program to check whether the input of numbers [SM] is amicable. A given of numbers is amicable if the sum of the proper divisors (not including itself) of one number is equal to the other number and vice-versa. Example: Proper divisors of 220: 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,.44, 55,and 110 Sum: 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110-284 Proper divisors 0f 284: 1,2,4, 71,and 142 Sum: 1+2+4+71+142-220 bs_ Predict the output of the following with proper justifications ISM] 1 Tinclude <stdio.h> 2 int gen (int} ; 3 int Gain (} 5 int i,j; 6 for (i-1;i<4;i++) 7 8 j-gen (1) ; 9 printf (\" 8d\",j) ; 10 11 return 0; 12 13 int gen (int x) 14 15 static int V-l,b-3; 16 VteX; 17 return (V+Xtb) ; 18 PTO Mriat Emy, explain txt\" Edge pair pair\n\n--- OCR Page 2 ---\nWrite a C program to dynamically = the numbers the user and allocate memory for 10 Further read HIOM] sort the numbers in the litore the numbers in the allocated memory. ascending order; Write a \u20ac program to display the Note: Do not use h> and smallest words in a Example: and <ctype.h> .
